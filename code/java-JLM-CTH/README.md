[EricLemerdy](http://github.com/ericlemerdy) suggested the [Katastrophic](https://github.com/ericlemerdy/katastrophic) code during a coding dojo in january 2014

With the great help and insight of Christophe Thibaut, we wrote this code, trying to play the Object Kalistenics way.

Katastrophic code is derivated from a spoj problem : http://www.spoj.com/submit/INVSTMRK/
